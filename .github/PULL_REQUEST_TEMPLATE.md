## Summary

<!-- What changed and why, in a few sentences. -->

## Linked task / issue

<!-- Task contract id and/or GitHub issue, e.g. GS-298 / #298. -->

## Risk class

<!-- R0 / R1 / R2 / R3 (see docs/governance/agentic-engineering.md).
     CI re-derives this from the diff and uses the higher of the two. -->

- Declared risk class:

## Base / head

- Base SHA:
- Head SHA:
- Stacked on (if applicable): base PR #___ at base SHA ___

## Scope

- Owned paths touched:
- Explicit non-goals (what this PR does NOT do):

## Invariants

<!-- Properties that must remain true (e.g. no resource leak on failure paths,
     host/shader layout in sync). -->

## User-visible behavior

<!-- Any change a user/developer would observe, or "none". -->

## Godot upstream delta

<!-- Does this touch servers/scene/core/editor/platform? If yes, justify. -->

## Validation

<!-- Exact commands and their results. Mark unavailable hardware as "not run". -->

```text

```

## GPU / performance evidence (R2+)

<!-- Runtime/GPU harness or benchmark evidence vs the immutable base; VRAM and
     frame-time numbers for perf/memory claims; real-scan visual validation for
     rendering-math changes. "N/A" for non-R2 changes. -->

## Review artifacts

<!-- Links to review results (correctness / GPU-performance), if produced. -->

## Known blind spots

<!-- What you could not verify (e.g. no AMD/Intel GPU evidence). -->

## Rollback plan

<!-- How to revert safely if this regresses. -->
