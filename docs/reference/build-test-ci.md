# Build / Test / CI Command Reference

Use this page when you already know you need a build, test, or CI command.
For the main build walkthrough, start with [Build from Source](../BUILDING.md).

## Build

- Base editor builds: use the canonical [Build from Source](../BUILDING.md) page.
- First visible result after a successful build: use [First Run](../getting-started/quick-start.md).

For test-enabled editor builds:

```bash
scons platform=<platform> target=editor dev_build=yes tests=yes -j<jobs>
```

> **Binary naming:** `dev_build=yes` adds a `.dev` segment to the output binary name.
> For example, Windows produces `bin/godot.windows.editor.dev.x86_64.exe`
> (not `bin/godot.windows.editor.x86_64.exe`).

## Test Runners

- Baseline QA:
  - `python3 tests/ci/run_baseline_qa.py --godot <module-built-binary>`
- Module checks/tests:
  - `python3 tests/ci/run_module_tests.py --guard-only`
  - `python3 tests/ci/run_module_tests.py --godot-binary <module-built-binary>`
- Runtime validation:
  - `python3 tests/runtime/run_runtime_validation.py --godot-binary <module-built-binary> --gd-mode headless`
- Benchmark suite:
  - `python3 tests/runtime/run_benchmark.py --godot-binary <module-built-binary> --profile everything`
- GPU test harness (visual gate):
  - `python3 tests/ci/run_gpu_harness.py --batch CompositorHazard --godot <module-built-binary>`
  - Direct doctest invocation: `<module-built-binary> --gs-gpu-test --test-case="*HazardRepro*"`

For module-only build commands and SCons targets, see [Gaussian Splatting Build and Test Guide](../../modules/gaussian_splatting/docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md). For test-runner overviews, see [Tests Overview](../../tests/README.md).

## GPU Test Harness and Visual Gate

The `--gs-gpu-test` entrypoint in `main/main.cpp` is a second doctest runner that boots `RenderingDevice` offscreen (no `SceneTree`, no window) for tests tagged `[RequiresGPU]`. `tests/ci/run_gpu_harness.py` is the Python supervisor that drives it in per-batch subprocesses so a driver hang or GPU OOM in one batch can't corrupt the next.

- Canonical detail (per-batch table, contracts, troubleshooting): [Testing Setup Guide — GPU Test Harness](../testing/setup-guide.md#gpu-test-harness-gs-gpu-test).
- Per-batch filter table and listener semantics: [`modules/gaussian_splatting/tests/README.md`](../../modules/gaussian_splatting/tests/README.md).
- Seeded golden captures and recapture workflow: [`tests/visual_baselines/README.md`](../../tests/visual_baselines/README.md).

Required-batch contract: `REQUIRED_BATCHES = {"CompositorHazard"}` is asserted at import in `tests/ci/run_gpu_harness.py`. A required batch whose doctest filter matches zero test cases fails the gate — this prevents a silently-green CI when a rename empties the canonical `#256` regression batch.

## CI Source of Truth

- [Workflow overview](../../.github/workflows/README.md)
- [Production gate workflow](../../.github/workflows/gaussian_production_gates.yml)
- [Baseline QA workflow (gpu-tests + gpu-harness visual gate)](../../.github/workflows/baseline_qa.yml)
- [Renderer release gate contract](renderer-release-gates.md)

Fork-PR safety gate: the `gpu-tests` and `gpu-harness` jobs in `baseline_qa.yml` both guard on `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`, so untrusted fork-PR code never executes on the self-hosted Windows GPU runner. Same-repo branch PRs and the merge queue still exercise the visual gate.

External advisory checks: `qlty check` is not part of the local renderer
release gate while `master` branch protection has no required status checks and
the repo has no tracked qlty configuration. Treat qlty as a non-blocking signal
unless branch protection or `docs/reference/renderer_release_gate_manifest.json`
is changed to require it.

## Common Failure Modes

- Wrong binary (stock Godot instead of module-enabled build)
- Missing toolchain dependencies (`scons`, shader compiler toolchain)
- Build path mismatch (for example using a stale editor outside this fork's `bin/` output)
